=head1 FTN::JAM ToDo

Correct issue with the following subroutines not ending with a return:
CloseMB, UnlockMB, FindUser.

Correct issue with using bareword file handles (ref also bug # 66608) in
the OpenMB & CloseMB functions.

Correct issue with using 2 argument open() calls instead of 3 argument
open() in the OpenMB & CloseMB functions.

Correct issue with how constants are defined & used: using something like
ReadOnly instead of the 'constant' pragma?

Create a file containing examples of using FTN::JAM, possibly using something
from the demo scripts as a basis.  Do this instead of simply cleaning up the
old demo scripts and including them in the distribution?

Add test subroutines for createing and removing a message base:  for that,
need to figure out where to put temporary files used with/for/in testing.
